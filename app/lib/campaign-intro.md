# ACC Campaign

After more than a year of on-and-off development and an extraordinary amount of work, we present the new ACC Campaign!

The campaign is initially divided into three paths, true, standard, and tech acc. You'll need to clear one path all the way to one of the ACC Champ milestones and pass it to join the clan. It's important to note that this campaign is not intended to be an introduction to acc, it starts hard and rapidly gets harder. At the time of writing, the final milestone and several of the levels preceding it aren't passable by anyone. All of the levels are simply acc requirements, there's none of the frustrating "maintain acc" challenges you might be familiar with from the 115 guild progression campaign.

## How To Play

We have a github repo with campaign zips that contains everything you need to play the campaign, just put it in your Beat Saber folder and extract it, that's all.
